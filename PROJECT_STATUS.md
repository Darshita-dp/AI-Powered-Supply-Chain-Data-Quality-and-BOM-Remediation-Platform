## Completed milestones

- **M0** — governance docs, architecture overview, ADR log (6 ADRs), ERD, DQ rule
  taxonomy (~45 rules), README skeleton, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`.
  Commit `994e6b5`, pushed.
- **M1** — `pyproject.toml` (ruff/mypy/pytest config, dependency groups), settings
  module (pydantic-settings, local-first defaults), structured JSON logging (structlog),
  4 passing unit tests, pre-commit config, Makefile, GitHub Actions CI skeleton
  (Python 3.12/3.13 matrix + frontend + gitleaks), Vite React-TS frontend with
  TanStack Query/router/vitest installed, app shell + 1 passing component test,
  CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/CHANGELOG.
- **M2** — synthetic ERP generator: 22 datasets, smoke/demo/full profiles, deterministic
  seeds, referential-integrity validation, tier-constructed multi-level acyclic BOMs,
  Typer CLI, manifest with measured counts. Measured runs: smoke = 13,843 records
  (1.2s), demo = 247,881 records (13.5s); full profile configured but not yet executed
  (scheduled for M20 performance evaluation). 8 unit tests.

## In-progress work

- None; next is M2.

## Last successful commit

- See `git log` (M1 commit).

## Tests currently passing

- Python: 12 unit tests (`pytest`), ruff + ruff-format + mypy clean.
- Frontend: 1 vitest test, oxlint clean, `tsc -b` clean, production build succeeds.
- CI workflow authored but not yet observed passing on GitHub (validates on push).

## Known failures

- None.

## External integrations

**Configured:** none.

**Not configured:**
- Snowflake (no credentials — local DuckDB fallback is the plan; Snowflake scripts will
  be authored but deployment status will be documented honestly)
- GitHub push auth: clone over HTTPS worked; push not yet attempted
- Power BI Desktop: availability unverified; fallback is a full source/build package
- Anthropic or other hosted AI provider: optional, not required for core tests

## Next exact action

Start M3: implement `data_generator/injectors/` — 25+ issue types with difficulty
levels, ground-truth labels kept separate from model inputs, injection manifest, and
tests proving correct injection. Commit
`feat: inject governed data quality defects with ground truth`.

## Honest completion percentage

**~13%** — foundation plus synthetic data generation; no quality/ML/API functionality yet.
